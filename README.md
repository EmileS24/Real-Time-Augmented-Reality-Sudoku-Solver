# Real-Time-Augmented-Reality-Sudoku-Solver
Developed a real-time AR sudoku solver using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on MNIST and Chars74K datasets, openCV and a recursive DFS algorithm which can capture an image from a webcam, detect and recognize the Sudoku puzzle grid, and then solve the puzzle in real-time. Used Pytorch, numpy and OpenCV.
