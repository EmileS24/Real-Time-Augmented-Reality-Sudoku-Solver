the project requires "python3" the following libraries:
=> torch, torchvision
=> numpy
=> cv2
=> matplotlib
=> tqdm

running "digitRecgonition.py" should train the model and generate the figure 6,7 and figure 8,9 in the report

"main.py" is the entry point and it should start the video camera for you to display a sudoku to it.
